#Unshredder

This was my entry to the [instagram challenge](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder), which netted me a few instagram buttons, which is nice. So I have that going for me.

The Unshredder is extremely fine tuned to the image provided by instagram, and I never go around to generalize it more. Therefore, it can only unshred the image provided for the challenge and no other image.
